**How to Run This React Native Expo project:**

1. **Install Expo CLI**
   Run the following command to install the Expo CLI globally:
   ```
   npm install -g expo-cli
   ```

2. **Create a new Expo project**
   Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project, and run the following command to create a new Expo project:
   ```
   expo init app
   ```
   This command will prompt you to choose a template for your project. You can select the option that best suits your needs (e.g., "blank" for a minimal setup, or "tabs" for a tabbed navigation structure).

3. **Navigate into the project directory**
   After the project setup is complete, navigate into the project directory:
   ```
   cd app
   ```

4. **Start the Expo development server**
   Run the following command to start the Expo development server:
   ```
   expo start
   ```
   This will open the Expo Developer Tools in your default web browser.

5. **Run the app on a simulator or physical device**
   - **iOS Simulator**: Press `i` in the Expo Developer Tools to run the app in the iOS simulator.
   - **Android Emulator**: Press `a` in the Expo Developer Tools to run the app in the Android emulator.
   - **Physical Device**: Scan the QR code displayed in the Expo Developer Tools with the Expo Go app (available on the App Store or Google Play Store) on your physical device.

6. **Make changes and see them live**
   With Expo's hot reloading feature, any changes you make to your code will be automatically reflected in the running app. Simply save your changes, and the app will refresh to display the updates.
